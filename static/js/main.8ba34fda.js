The site utilized NLP to extract relevant files and responses from a large database based on user input in natural language. Similar to Google, this site was able to search through various types of data including news, scientific and technical information, and more. \n\nTo process the data, Elasticsearch was used for its powerful querying capabilities. When a user entered a search term, an Elasticsearch query was generated using OpenAI's technology. The query was then pre-processed and passed on to the search engine.\nI used node.js for the backend and React for the frontend.\nMost of what I was responsible for in this project was frontend, REST api and admin dashboard.\nAs for a development on my side, I have used React, material UI, Tailwind CSS, Axios for the REST api, react-saga for redux.\n\nAnother interesting project I worked on was a chatbot that utilized ML. Two key features of this chatbot were its learning function and field selection. To train the chatbot, learning materials were manually prepared and the chatbot was trained for a week. During this time, the field was set as healthcare and appropriate information was selected and learned. As a result, customer service work was reduced by over 20%.\n\nI gave importance to the code optimization, responsiveness and the render speed.\nThe most exciting thing was that I used some of react hook functions in this project such as useMemo, useCallback so that I can reduce unnecessary rendering into components.\nAs a result, my customers gave me good feedbacks and reviews.\n        "},{title:"What was your last project and what you have done on it? or Briefly summarize your recent contributions to either a web application or API service.",type:0,content:"My greatest accomplishment was developing Project ISLA, a healthcare system that made a significant impact. \n        I created a versatile search tool that helps people find hospital information and analytics for over 3,000 hospitals nationwide.\n         Using React, Django, and Elasticsearch, I built a user-friendly platform that includes features like hospital mapping and detailed statistics. \n         I'm particularly proud of optimizing the site's performance using advanced React techniques, which resulted in faster loading times and a smoother user experience. \n         The project was a huge success, earning great feedback from customers and potentially saving the healthcare system up to 500,000 dollars by improving efficiency and access to information.\n         This experience taught me the value of combining technical skills with real-world problem-solving to create meaningful solutions in healthcare"},{title:"Tell me about yourself or Tell me about your work experience",type:0,content:"First of all, let me tell you about myself.\n        I am a front-end JavaScript developer with 10 years of experience.       \n       I specialize in Web and Decentralized applications, and in addition to front-end development, I am interested in Web Design, back-end development and GraphQL.       \n        My great performances are in TypeScript, JavaScript and its libraries such as React, Redux, Web3.js, etc.       \n       I also have strong knowledge in Data Structure & Algorithm, which always helps me build robust applications.\n       My software developer career was started when I was a university student at the Hong Kong College of Technology.\n       When I was a sophomore, I really loved maths, and later programming so I was selected as one of the Programing contest candidates and participated in a training team.\n       In the team, I learned and practised modern data structrues and algorithmic patterns.\n       That was my meaningful start in the software developers\u2019 world.\n       Later my skills expanded amazingly, especially in React.

Once it has this tree, in order to figure out how the UI should change in response to the new state, React will diff this new tree against the previous element tree.\n        By doing this, React will then know the exact changes which occurred, and by knowing exactly what changes occurred, will able to minimize its footprint on the UI by only making updates where absolutely necessary."},{title:"What is the difference between Element and Component in ReactJS?",type:1,content:"An element is a plain object describing what I want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components.

The keys of an Object are Strings and Symbols, whereas they can be any value for a Map, including functions, objects, and any primitive.\n   2.

A Map is an iterable and can thus be directly iterated, whereas iterating over an Object requires obtaining its keys in some fashion and iterating over them.\n   5. An Object has a prototype, so there are default keys in the map that could collide with your keys if you're not careful.

Since the variable i is declared with the `var` keyword it became a global variable and the value was equal to 4 using iteration when the time `setTimeout` function is invoked. Hence, the output of the first loop is `4 4 4 4`.\n\n     Whereas in the second loop, the variable i is declared as the `let` keyword it becomes a block scoped variable and it holds a new value(0, 1 ,2 3) for each iteration.

A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original object. If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects, just the reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address is copied.\n\n     **Example**\n\n     ---javascript\n     var empDetails = {\n       name: "John",\n       age: 25,\n       expertise: "Software Developer",\n     };\n     ---\n\n     to create a duplicate\n\n     ---javascript\n     var empDetailsShallowCopy = empDetails; //Shallow copying!\n     ---\n\n     if we change some property value in the duplicate one like this:\n\n     ---javascript\n     empDetailsShallowCopy.name = "Johnson";\n     ---\n\n     The above statement will also change the name of `empDetails`, since we have a shallow copy. That means we\'re losing the original data as well.\n\n     **Deep copy:**\n     A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields. A deep copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.\n\n     **Example**\n\n     ---javascript\n     var empDetails = {\n       name: "John",\n       age: 25,\n       expertise: "Software Developer",\n     };\n     ---\n\n     Create a deep copy by using the properties from the original object into new variable\n\n     ---javascript\n     var empDetailsDeepCopy = {\n       name: empDetails.name,\n       age: empDetails.age,\n       expertise: empDetails.expertise,\n     };\n     ---\n\n     Now if you change `empDetailsDeepCopy.name`, it will only affect `empDetailsDeepCopy` & not `empDetails`\n\n     '},{title:"How do you create specific number of copies of a string",type:3,content:"\n     The `repeat()` method is used to construct and return a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string on which it was called, concatenated together.

But if you want to trim especially at the beginning or ending of the string then you can use `trimStart/trimLeft` and `trimEnd/trimRight` methods. Let\'s see an example of these methods on a greeting message,\n\n     ---javascript\n     var greeting = "   Hello, Goodmorning!   ";\n\n     console.log(greeting); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!

The `this` keyword of a regular function(i.e, diameter) refers to the surrounding scope which is a class(i.e, Shape object).

Examples of this include outline, visibility, or background color. A _reflow_ involves changes that affect the layout of a portion of the page (or the whole page). Resizing the browser window, changing the font, content changing (such as user typing text), using JavaScript methods involving computed styles, adding or removing elements from the DOM, and changing an element's classes are a few of the things that can trigger reflow.
